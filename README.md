Implementation of the paper Particle-based Viscoelastic Fluid Simulation (Simon Clavet, Philippe Beaudoin, and Pierre Poulin)
[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1073368.1073400]

# sim.js
Implements up to and including Section 3, Simulation Step. Similar to verlet integration, we also track position, and previous position, and use those to compute velocity. Velocity is also stored to be further operated on in the viscosity step.

Implements Section 4, Double Density Relaxation, but neighbor search is O(n^2). Note that for this paper, the inner j loop starts at 0 and not i + 1.

Implements spatial hashing. You can toggle on/off to see the performance difference.

Iterates through active buckets instead of via particles to try to get more locality.

Implements Section 5, elasticity and viscosity. Spring adjustment is where I had to make some changes to the paper to improve stability.
- Alg. 4, Ln. 5 - New springs are added with rest length starting at the current distance between the particles (r_ij) instead of h
- Moved where the new springs are added to inside the double-density relaxation method (loop combining optimization)
- Added a parameter of min dist for springs so springs that are too short aren't created when the material is slammed
- Alg. 5 - Added clamp to the inward radial velocity

# TODO
- add rain
- look at changing this to air sim, for helicopter physics testing
